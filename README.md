# painter-pal

Painter Pal is a Progressive Web App, developed using Ionic and Angular.

The purpose of this app was to develop a mobile application that helps miniature painters keep track of their collection, and allows other miniature painters to connect with their community.

This app was created for Special Topics 480 - Spring 2019. The focus of this class was on User Interface/User Experience, so our group's focus was not on whether the app could connect to a database, but rather to demo an understanding of user interface and design principles.
This being said, fair warning - the app will not save any information upon page refresh.

* NOTE: To get the full PWA experience, save the webpage to your home screen via Chrome or Safari and open the app from your home screen.
